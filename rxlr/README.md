This is a pipeline for identifying RxLR's in n-gen genomes. 
At present this is partially optimised for grid engine, with the signal p portions of the pipeline
being sent out to grid engine. The problem still remaining is how to resume a script after the grid engine
jobs are done. 

Furthermore, there are probably other tweaks that need to be carried out in order to streamline the 
pipeline.
